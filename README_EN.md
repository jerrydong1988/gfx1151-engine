A local inference engine that runs a 177B MoE model on a single AMD Strix
Halo APU (gfx1151). Target model: Qwen3.8-Flash-Next (qwen4_exp architecture)
and fine-tunes with the same architecture.

The routed experts are stored in host memory in 4-bit quantization and read
directly by the GPU kernels — no large VRAM needed. The memory-resident
weights are ~67–77 GiB depending on the weight format (the PLE n-gram table
stays on disk and is read on demand); a machine with 122 GiB of RAM can serve
a 256K context.

## Measured Performance

Development machine: **GMK EVO-X2 (AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395, Strix Halo /
gfx1151)**, 122 GiB RAM:

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Prefill (128K context) | ~1400–1470 tok/s (measured 09-28) |
| Decode (speculative, greedy, γ=4) | ~45 tok/s at 8K, ~46 at 64K (real text, 09-29) |
| Decode (speculative, sampling, adaptive γ) | ~40 tok/s at 8K, ~45 at 64K (real text, 09-29) |
| Decode (no speculation) | ~25–30 tok/s (measured 09-28, depends on weight format) |
| Average power draw | ~120 W |
| Peak (instantaneous) power draw | ~130 W (bursts for a few seconds, then settles back to ~120 W) |

Speculative decode varies strongly with text repetitiveness: the two rows
above were measured on real-text prompts; highly repetitive content (code,
template text) hits the chain drafter well and exceeds 60 tok/s in the same
configuration. Numbers vary with the weight format (GGUF / hgn); all dates
are in 2026.

## Weight Formats and Quality

The engine supports two weight formats. Service, API and speculative
decoding are identical; switch by using the other launcher:

| | hgn standard | hgn high quality (HQ) | GGUF UD-Q4_K_XL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Files | current default (`qwen38-flash-next-w4b.hgn` + overlay) | converted from the original weights, see [HGN-HQ.md](HGN-HQ.md) (Chinese) | released by Unsloth, the same files llama.cpp uses |
| Routed experts | 4-bit (q4cp) | 4-bit (q4cp, imatrix-weighted) | mostly Q4_K / Q5_1 |
| Dense (attention, GDN, shared expert, embed, lm_head) | 4-bit | 8-bit (q8g32 overlay) | 8-bit (Q8_0) |
| KLD vs BF16 (lower is better) | 0.163 | **0.0558** | 0.0511 |
| top1 agreement with BF16 | 86.8% | 92.4% | 92.6% |
| Resident weights bpw / size | 4.55 / 66.6 GiB | 4.70 / 68.8 GiB | 5.25 / 76.9 GiB |
| Prefill (8K prompt, chunk 2048) | ~1200 tok/s | ~1200 tok/s | ~1200 tok/s |
| Decode (no speculation) | ~30 tok/s | ~25 tok/s | ~25 tok/s |
| Launch | `start_hgn.sh` | `start_hgn.sh` (set `MODEL_FILE` / `OVERLAY_FILE`) | `start_gguf.sh` |
| Windows | yes | yes (not yet measured) | no |

- KLD: BF16 reference, wikitext-2, 64 chunks × 512, measured the same way as
  unsloth / llama.cpp (see [KLD.md](KLD.md), Chinese); llama.cpp on the same
  GGUF gives 0.049.
- Almost the whole quality gap comes from the dense bit width: 8-bit dense
  takes KLD from 0.163 to 0.063, imatrix-weighted experts bring it to 0.0558.
  The cost is more bytes read per decode token, ~16% slower decode (same as
  GGUF); prefill is unaffected.
- Resident weights exclude the PLE n-gram table (hgn fp8 47.7 GiB, GGUF
  IQ4_NL 26.8 GiB), which stays on disk and is read on demand.
  `python3 tools/bpw.py` reports bpw per category for each file (reads headers
  only, a few seconds).
- The default configuration is still hgn standard. The HQ files pass
  `tools/hq_verify.sh`; deployment is described in section 6 of
  [HGN-HQ.md](HGN-HQ.md).

## Features

- **Speculative decoding chain**: ngram drafts first, MTP as fallback, with
  round-by-round fallback; greedy does bit-exact comparison, sampling
  resamples and compares against the target distribution, so the output
  distribution is identical to serial decoding. Enabled by default, no
  parameters needed; the draft length γ is chosen per mode (fixed 4 for
  greedy, adaptive by acceptance rate for sampling) and can be pinned with
  `MTP_GAMMA=1-8`. Highly repetitive content (code comments, template
  text) shows significant measured speedups.
- **Standalone 8-bit MTP draft weights** sidecar, with a higher acceptance
  rate than the built-in 4-bit draft head.
- **Vision**: supports image input (OpenAI `image_url`), with KV reuse
  across turns.
- **OpenAI-compatible API**: streaming, tool calling,
  `/v1/chat/completions`.
- **256K context**, with a paged KV pool and two-tier prompt caching:
  in-RAM checkpoints at message boundaries (edit-and-resend replies
  instantly) plus KV snapshots recovered across restarts.
- **Concurrent requests**: multiple requests share one paged KV pool (4
  slots by default, 256K total — similar to llama.cpp's shared context);
  the GPU round-robins between requests and each request's output is
  bit-identical to running alone; long-prompt prefill is chunked to yield
  the GPU, capping other sessions' worst stall at ~0.6 s. Configuration
  and semantics in [CONCURRENCY.md](CONCURRENCY.md) (Chinese).
- **Two weight formats**: the native `.hgn` (Linux / Windows) and llama.cpp
  GGUF (Unsloth UD-Q4_K_XL, Linux); comparison above.
- **Model conversion tool**: HF safetensors → `.hgn`. The default output is
  the high-quality variant (8-bit dense overlay + weighted 4-bit experts); a
  llama.cpp-format imatrix is used if you have one, and conversion works
  without one too. Usable for your own fine-tunes of the same architecture
  (see [HGN-HQ.md](HGN-HQ.md), [CONVERT_EN.md](CONVERT_EN.md)).

## Requirements

- Linux + ROCm (HIP 7.x), GPU architecture `gfx1151`; or Windows + AMD GPU
  driver (the GPU needs VRAM carved out in BIOS), see the "Windows" section
- Available memory ≥ 100 GiB (pinned (page-locked) weights: ~68 GiB for hgn,
  ~80 GiB for GGUF, plus KV)
- Build dependencies: rocBLAS, hipBLASLt, rocPRIM; the API frontend also
  needs libpng, libjpeg, libwebp; nlohmann/json is vendored in the repository

## Quick Start

```bash
bash build.sh        # Build engine + API, output goes to build/
bash start_hgn.sh    # hgn weights: load the model and start the service (reads service.conf)
bash start_gguf.sh   # or GGUF weights (Unsloth UD-Q4_K_XL, the same files llama.cpp uses)
```

Both launchers read weights from `./models` and list any missing files before
exiting; configuration is centralized in `service.conf` (one section each for
hgn and GGUF; GGUF details in [GGUF.md](GGUF.md)). See [QUICKSTART_EN.md](QUICKSTART_EN.md)
for details.

Converting your own fine-tuned model (HF safetensors, same architecture):

```bash
# without an imatrix
python3 tools/flashnext2hgn.py /path/to/hf-model --out ./models
# with an imatrix (llama.cpp format: GGUF or legacy imatrix.dat)
python3 tools/flashnext2hgn.py /path/to/hf-model --out ./models --imatrix /path/to/imatrix.gguf
```

It writes the base `.hgn`, the 8-bit dense overlay, the 8-bit MTP draft, the
vision tower, the tokenizer and a ready-to-run `start.sh`; ~1.5 hours on 32
cores, ~125 GiB of disk, needs only numpy. `--classic` is the old data-free
converter (byte-identical output to before). High-quality conversion: see
[HGN-HQ.md](HGN-HQ.md); format and the old converter: see
[CONVERT_EN.md](CONVERT_EN.md).

## Windows

The Windows version has feature parity with the Linux version (engine +
OpenAI API + multimodal). Porting notes and measurements are in
[PORTING-WINDOWS_EN.md](PORTING-WINDOWS_EN.md). Builds run in Git Bash
(or double-click `build_win.bat`; Git is only needed at build time):

```bash
bash build_win.sh           # Engine
bash build_win.sh api       # OpenAI API frontend
bash build_win.sh launcher  # Script-free launcher start_win.exe
```

For daily use, double-click `start_win.exe` (native Win32, no
Git/PowerShell needed): it brings up the engine + API dual processes,
without a console window: it only puts a tray icon in the notification area
(right-click: open dashboard / copy API URL / view logs / quit; double-click:
open dashboard), and output goes to `logs\`. For troubleshooting,
`start_win.exe --console` restores the console mode (Ctrl+C or closing the
window stops it). Configuration is **shared with Linux via
`service.conf`** (edit it to change the model file name or context
window); environment variables can temporarily override it. Clients
connect to `http://<host>:8731/v1`.

Distribution: copy `build/` + `start_win.exe` + `models/` to any gfx1151
Windows machine and it just works — **no ROCm/TheRock installation
needed**; only the AMD GPU driver, plus enough VRAM carved out for the GPU
in BIOS (a 256K context needs 96 GiB).

Differences from the Linux version:

- Only hgn weights are supported: usable VRAM on Windows is capped at
  about 96 GiB, and GGUF weights are larger (hgn saves ~11 GiB over GGUF)
  and do not fit — `start_gguf.sh` does not apply; hgn weights are
  produced by the conversion tool, see [CONVERT_EN.md](CONVERT_EN.md).
  The high-quality hgn works by swapping files: weight arena +2.2 GiB,
  estimated ~93.2 GiB at 256K / chunk 8192 (limit 95); not yet measured
  on Windows
- Image decoding supports PNG/JPEG via stb_image (WebP not wired up)
- Prefill chunk defaults to 8192
- Cold loading reads the full weights from disk (minute-scale, progress
  shown in console/logs)
- The launchers do not enable `GDEC_GEMM_WMMA` or `GDEC_GDN_FUSED` (the
  self-written WMMA GEMM and fused GDN kernel already promoted on Linux
  launchers, worth ~8-10% PP combined but unverified under TheRock — so
  Windows prefill uses hipBLASLt plus the legacy GDN path)

Known issues (root causes unknown; there are quite a few quirks, fixes
pending, priority very low):

- VRAM allocations above 41 GiB or 63 GiB fail
- The model hangs during decode (suspected console output backpressure: once
  the console is paused by a click/selection, child processes block on logging.
  Fixed: the launcher is now a tray app whose logs bypass the console, and
  kvsnap no longer prints while holding its lock; pending verification)

## Tests

```bash
bash build.sh test     # Kernel unit tests, no model loading, expect ALL PASS
python3 tools/bpw.py   # bpw of the weights under models/ by category (headers only)
```

Quality (KLD) testing needs a BF16 reference; see [KLD.md](KLD.md).

## Acknowledgements

This project's implementation borrows from [halogen-flash-server](https://github.com/peonist-ai/halogen-flash-server) by peonist-ai. The `.hgn` weight container format is halogen's checkpoint container format — see [HGN-FORMAT_EN.md](HGN-FORMAT_EN.md). Many thanks to the halogen authors.

GGUF support heavily references [gufo](https://github.com/gufo-org/gufo) (MIT license): the routed-expert F16 WMMA GEMM kernel is ported from its RoutedF16GEMMKernel (`src/gpu/parts/26_kernels_moe_gguf.inc`); the LUT-decoded variants for hgn q4cp / GGUF IQ4 follow the same pipeline (`27_kernels_moe_lut.inc`); the GGUF↔engine tensor transform semantics reference its reference.cpp (`src/gguf_map.h`). Prefill optimizations such as HC gate fusion and producer epilogues writing the next GEMM's input directly also borrow from gufo's approach (comparison analysis in [GUFO-GAP.md](GUFO-GAP.md), Chinese).

The ngram speculative drafting approach and the two-tier prompt cache borrow ideas from the open-source [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) (MIT license); GGUF weights and the vision tower (mmproj) reuse the very same files as llama.cpp. See the "Attribution" section of [NGRAM_EN.md](NGRAM_EN.md).
